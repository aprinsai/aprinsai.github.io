				<h2>Finding housing in Munich</h2>
				<p>I think it is widely known that it is not easy to find a place to live in Munich.
        I would even say that Germany has a housing problem in all of its big cities. For example in Cologne barely 46% of the housing needs of citizens are being met, in Stuttgart the number is 56%  while in Munich 67%.
        So, the demand exceeds the supply and thus housing is scarse and expensive. In this blog I'm gonna tell our experiences in the hopes of helping other people.
        </p>

      <div class ="innertube">
        <p>First of all, I want to give major credits to my boyfriend. He really invested a lot of time and effort into finding us a place and I am so thankful that it worked out.
        The blog that really helped him you can find <a href="https://medium.com/@tungfam/how-to-find-an-apartment-in-munich-germany-68eebac6957c">here</a>.
        Be prepared to send out many applications. We send out around 100 applications in total and got about 10 visits out of that. When you send out so many applications it is key to be structered.
        Like in the blog, we had a Google Drive folder with all our documents. That includes a CV of us together, so that people can get to know us; Copies of our passports; copies of my contract with my employer;
        bankstatements; bankstatements of parents; SCHUFA and other information that proves that we are good people and have money to pay the rent. We can then easily share this folder with a possible Vermieter and they have all the documents they need.
      </p>
      <p>We joined 10 thousand housing Facebook groups and asked a bunch of people that we knew if they had any connections in Munich for housing.
      In the end, the Facebooks groups were not that successful for us, they are very messy and often the people that put ads up there are looking for someone to join their WG, which was not something that we were looking for.
    Also, asking around did not help a great amount in the end. Nick has a  business partner who knows people here and we actually got offered an appartment but it was too expensive for us. </p>
    <p>We took a premium subscription on <a href = "https://www.immobilienscout24.de/">Immoscout 24</a> so that we would have good insights on what our chances were and that our message would be on top of the list.
    I think it was a good investment, people were often thrown off because Nick is still a student so we had to make sure that the people that were fine with that would actually see our message.
  Furthermore, we had our search preferences saved and Immo would send us e-mails with all the new appartments. We had a spreadsheet with all the applications links, the status, the person who was renting it and the address of course. </p>

	To actually find a place, we went to Munich. My boyfriend went for two whole weeks and I went only for one week. We rented an Airbnb close to the U-bahn station Poccistraße, which is located in a pretty central place.
	In the end, it cost us a bit under €500. When Nick was there alone, he visited two newly built appartments in Pasing. They were a little more expensive but they both had a kitchen and everything was brand new. We actually got the appartments offered to us,
	but we did not take them. We rejected them because we thought the nearest station (S-bahn) was too far away on foot. Also, the rent was higher than we were hoping for.
	As time went on, we realised it would have actually been a good place for us. Lots of appartments do not have a kitchen so you also have to make that investment then.
	Also, we did not realise at the time that Pasing was such a nice area. I looked on Google maps and it seemed like a dead neighbourhood but it turned out to be pretty nice with a cosy centre.
</p><p>
	Furthermore, we noticed quickly that people were not so keen on taking us in. I was still working in the Netherlands and Nick is a student so that was not really helpful.
	We had two places actually where we were pretty certain we would get the places. However, they did not accept us in the end because of Nick.
	It was probably more helpful if I had been the one applying to all the appartments but we had the trouble that I don't speak German that well.
	So eventually it became clear that we had to have one of our parents pay for rent. </p>
	<p>
	Now... the two weeks were almost coming to an end and we were in need of a place to live. On the last saturday, we had a visit at a private Vermieter.
	With private renters, I feel the situation is always a bit different to rental agencies. These agencies tend to choose for the most reliable person on paper,
	which does not tend to be students. I feel like we have a better chance with a private renter because you are talking to someone as a person, and they maybe choose a new tenant a bit more based on feeling.
	I would say rental agencies choose with their heads, but private renters more with their heart. So I already had a good feeling, before we had even met.
	It turned out to be right and she gave us a call on saturday evening that we could have the appartment!
	Maybe it is not exactly what we had hoped for, everything is tad outdated, but we have a very nice landlady and that is not something that I have been able to say before!
