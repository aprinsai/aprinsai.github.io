				<h2>What is this place?</h2>
				<p>I created this simple blog/website because when I was planning on moving to Munich with my boyfriend I couldn't really find a blog that satisfied my curiousity regarding Munich.
          So I am hoping to do that for you, while at the same time practising my programming skills.

				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>My name is Anouk, currently 23 years old and I am moving to Munich on the 1st of November 2020.
          I am originally from the Netherlands and I studied Artificial Intelligence there.
          While studying I met my boyfriend, Nick who is 24 years old and from Germany.
					Currently I do not speak German. I'm trying to learn it though, so if you find this while you are in Munich and want to meet then feel free to shoot me a message.
        </p>
