				<h2>Outside in lockdown</h2>
				<p> <b>21-03-2021</b> </p>
				<p>
          It has been a good while since I wrote here. I was unsure whether I wanted to write anything because I felt like I had not experienced anything interesting. But looking back I did a bunch of interesting stuff.
          For work I started playing with SQL and I feel like I can now use it in a basic way. I'm following a course online and I have plenty of material at work to look at and practice with. I also am thinking about starting my master here.
          I was looking into Information Systems at the TUM, which sounds like something I would enjoy doing. I asked for some more information regarding studying there but I got a bit of a hostile answer from the TUM.
          Anyway, turns out I need to really know my German if I want to succeed there so I am working on that with Nick. I might also take a German course so that I have some 'professional' tutoring :) Furthermore, we have been doing some stuff here around the appartment.
          It's finally coming together and it is starting to feel really cosy here!

          <p>
            Alright, let's get down to business. What did I do here during lockdown that might actually interest other people? With a friend that I met here we took the train a couple of times to the mountains.
            First time was very adventurous. We bought a Bayern ticket for the two of us and took the train to Kochel am See (RB66). We picked out a route that looked very nice. The weather was cold but it was sunny and we were enjoying the sun.
            We both were wearing our Nike's and after a while we realized that had been a mistake. We saw so many Germans that actually properly prepared for a hike and looked super professional. They had walking sticks,
            actual good walking shoes and proper clothes and jackets. We looked like real noobs (which we were) and were laughing so hard at our choices. Anyway, we had a great time but I cannot recommend to go hiking on sneakers.
            Kochel was beautiful and there were a bunch of paths there, for all hiking levels.

          <p>
            Next time we went hiking, we went to Lenggries with the RB56. Again we bought a Bayern ticket and took a direct train there. We decided on an easier route and we had a great time in the snow. We had some really cool views.
            Only downside was that because it was freezing there were a lot of icy paths. Even our new hikingshoes couldn't beat that so we kinda sled down some paths.

            At some point it was really snowing a lot in Munich and I was loving it. Nick's cousin has a girlfriend whose parents live close to the mountains in Asschau. So when they invited us for sledging in the mountains we said yes of course!
            We took the train to a village closeby and they picked us up and drove to the mountains. There was a small piste but it was terribly busy with children. We walked up the piste and around it to find a path where they had gone earlier.
            We crossed the Austrian border and found this completely empty field with hills. We brought beers and were sledging down in the fresh snow. It was very lovely and a beautiful spot. I will include some pictures.

              Alright, enough about hiking. Because of the lockdown there really was not much to do other than hanging out outside. I felt like I had seen all the parks and especially the English garden.
              But I was wrong! At some point me and a friend decided to go for a bike ride. We wanted to cycle along the Isar and just see where we would end up. Since we already went south once while walking, we decided this time to go north.
              At first it was quite busy but after a while it got better. We crossed the river at a huge pumping station/water mill and ended up in the English garden. It was very calm here and it wasn't so crazy busy as it always is close to the city center.
              Here we put down our bikes and ate our buns. There were small kiosks when we drove back so next time we will probably get some food and drinks here. All in all, accidentally found this much more quiet piece of the English garden and I'm excited to explore more of this huge park.
